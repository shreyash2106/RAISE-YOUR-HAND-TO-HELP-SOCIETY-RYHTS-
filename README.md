# RAISE-YOUR-HAND-TO-HELP-SOCIETY-RYHTS-
Developed a public donation system using C++ that enables users to donate money or choose a donation scheme for three different areas (food, clothing, and housing).
The program, ‘Raise Your Hand to Help Society’ System (RYHTS) has been created from an administrator point of view which involves making use of concepts of object-oriented programming for booking, addition and manipulation of flight, passenger and transaction data securely. The program is an example of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) as it implements classes, objects and data file handling. 

In a society where there is a mix of well-off people as well as people in a dire state of economic and social conditions, it is our duty to help those in need. Thus, the RYHTS program was born. The program’s aim is to provide a system and a platform for the public to provide aid and help to the poor and needy people in our society. It is a no-profit initiative with all the funds going for the benefit of the poor. One can donate food, clothe or even land or money for housing.
